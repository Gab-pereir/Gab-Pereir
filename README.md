Hi! 🚀

I am studying Systems Analysis and Development with a ProUni scholarship. I am a technician in Internet Informatics and Electronics, and currently, I am focused on improving my skills in front-end and back-end development.

At the moment, I am looking for an internship opportunity to start my career in the technology field 👦🏽. I have over 8 months of professional experience providing freelance services.

I use technologies such as HTML, Sass, Javascript, Bootstrap, Python, and Java. Currently, I am exploring deepening my knowledge in ReactJS / NextJS 👨🏽‍💻.

🖥️ Although I am passionate about computing in general, I have a great interest in front-end development. For this reason, I constantly seek to improve my knowledge of interfaces, methods, and processes.

Feel free to explore my repositories!
